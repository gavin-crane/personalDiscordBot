# personalDiscordBot
A discord bot that im working on. Has basic commands like weather and has chatGPT integrated.

chatGPT functionality:
- Using the the command prefix followed by 'ai' and then a question, allows you to talk to chat gpt using the openAI API.
- Using this command will log all the command arguments to the text file 'aiConvoLog.txt'
- The ai's response to the question will also be logged to the file.
- The purpose of this log is so that the ai can read it and remember what was said earlier in the conversation.
- Using the command prefix followed by 'byeai' will clear the contents of the log.
